# smart-gools

smart-gools is a simple lib you can use, by saving some memory for multiple booleans.
I know that in go you already can save booleans in one byte, but this project is just for testing and practicing.

## What is this project about?

The problem is, that one single boolean takes a hole byte of memory, but it will use only one bit.
That tool will solve this problem by saving 8 booleans in one byte, so you can save some memory, if you have a lot of booleans.
